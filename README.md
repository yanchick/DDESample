# ArXiv Papers Analysis Pipeline Demo

## 🎓 Educational Project Disclaimer
This project is designed as an educational demonstration for students learning data engineering concepts. It showcases a basic ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline implementation and should not be used in production without proper modifications and improvements.

## 📝 Project Overview
This demo project demonstrates a data engineering pipeline that:
1. Collects academic papers data from arXiv.org
2. Processes the papers using LLM (Large Language Model)
3. Performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Stores the results in a SQLite database
5. Orchestrates the workflow using Prefect

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understanding ETL pipeline construction
- Working with REST APIs
- Implementing data processing with LLMs
- Database operations with SQLAlchemy
- Data orchestration with Prefect
- Basic data analysis and visualization
- Project structure and organization

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key (for LLM processing)
- Basic understanding of Python and data engineering concepts

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/arxiv-analysis-demo.git
cd arxiv-analysis-demo
```

2. Create and activate virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Create `.env` file and add your OpenAI API key:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### Running the Pipeline

1. Start Prefect server:
```bash
prefect server start
```

2. In a new terminal, run the main script:
```bash
python main.py
```

## 📊 Features
- **Data Collection**: Fetches academic papers from arXiv using their API
- **LLM Processing**: Analyzes papers using OpenAI's GPT models
- **Data Analysis**: Generates visualizations and statistics about the collected papers
- **Data Storage**: Stores processed data in SQLite database using SQLAlchemy
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Manages the pipeline using Prefect

## ⚠️ Educational Notes
This project is simplified for educational purposes. In a production environment, you would need to consider:
- Proper error handling and retry mechanisms
- Data validation and cleaning
- Security best practices
- Scalability considerations
- Testing coverage
- Monitoring and logging
- Cost optimization for API usage

## 🔧 Customization
You can modify the project by:
- Changing the search query in `config.py`
- Adjusting the LLM prompts in `llm_processor.py`
- Adding new analysis metrics in `data_analyzer.py`
- Extending the database schema in `models.py`

## 🎓 Educational Context
This project is meant to demonstrate:
- Basic ETL pipeline construction
- Integration of different technologies
- Code organization and project structure
- Basic data engineering practices

Remember that this is a simplified version for learning purposes. Real-world implementations would require additional considerations for production use.

## ❗ Limitations
- Basic error handling
- No authentication/authorization
- Limited scalability
- Simplified data processing
- Basic testing implementation

## 🤔 Next Steps for Learning
- Add more robust error handling
- Implement data validation
- Add monitoring and logging
- Implement more complex data transformations
- Add authentication and security measures
- Explore different database solutions
- Implement more comprehensive testing

Remember: This is a learning tool, not a production-ready solution. Use it to understand concepts and build your own improved versions!
